1. Given a set of integers S, find any subset which adds to given target T.

    Example: 

    S = {1, -10, 9, 4, 3, 2, 50, 12, 13, -5}

    T = 20



2. Given a set of integers, find if it is possible to divide it into two groups such that sum of one group is a multiple of 5 and sum of the other is odd.



3. Implement power(x, y), x raised to the power y, using Top-Down recursion.
